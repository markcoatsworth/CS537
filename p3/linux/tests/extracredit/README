The two tests are freetest.c and freetest2.c

freetest.c tests allocating and then freeing memory between two blocks that remain allocated. The test then attempts to allocate into the newly freed memory.

freetest2.c tests allocating and then freeing memory above and below a block that remains allocated. The test then attempts to allocate into the newly freed memory.

Both of these tests belong in bucket for workload 2 and 3 (they work for both 2 and 3, not sure if you want to test it in 3 as well. Up to your discretion).

I added some print statments at the end so that students could see if the tests succeeded.
