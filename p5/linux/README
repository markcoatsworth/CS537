Linux-Implementation Details:
*	Pretty straightforward, I implemented this pretty much as directed by the project file
*	I "cheated" a bit with the bitmap array. Since we have 4096 bytes per block and only 1024 data blocks, I just used a 4-byte integer to represent each data block. This was horribly wasteful, but also really easy :)
*	For the MFS API, I started by writing the MFS_Stat() function, then I copied + pasted it and made small changes to build out the other functions. This resulted in a lot of duplicate code, which technically is bad, but in this case made the different functions modular and much easier to debug.

XV6-Implementation Details:
*	Did not do P5b -- I'll take this one as my drop assignment.
