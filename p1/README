Part 1. Birthday Paradox

This is a fairly simple program which follows the instructions given in the project description.

To my knowledge, everything works correctly.

I've included various error checks:
	* Incomplete or missing command-line parameters
	* Missing input file
	* Input values outside the 1..365 range

Sample execution:
	[macaroni-01] coatsworth@~/private/cs537/p1/paradox $ gcc -O -Wall -o paradox paradox.c
	[macaroni-01] coatsworth@~/private/cs537/p1/paradox $ cat input.txt

Part 2. XV6

To solve this problem, I mostly followed the instructions given in the September 9 discussion:
	* syscall.h: Added a new definition, #define SYS_addnum 22
	* syscall.c: Added the new system call to *syscalls[] pointer list
	* defs.h: Added a new integer, addnum_counter, to store the value of repeated addnum calls
	* user.h: Added the definition of the user funtion, addnum(int);
	* sysproc.c: This is where I coded the actual sys_addnum() system call.
	* Probably some other file changes from the discussion which I'm forgetting...

I also wrote a test executable, addnum-test, which can be invoked from the xv6 shell:
	* user/addnum-test.c: Test executable which calls the addnum() function
	* user/makefile.mk: Added addnum-test to the makefile list
	
Sample execution:
