$ make qeum-nox-gdb

This starts qemu, but waits for gdb before it really gets started

In another terminal prompt (in the same directory) run:

$ gdb

You also need to have a file called ~/.gdbinit with:

set solib-search-path
add-auto-load-safe-path /afs/cs.wisc.edu/u/v/i/coatsworth/private/cs537/...

How to use:

(gdb) c
 -> Continue execution

(gdb) break scheduler
 -> Sets a breakpoint so that every time the scheduler() function is called, it stops and waits

(gdb) c
 -> Now continue the execution and wait for the scheduler() function is run 
 
(gdb) l
 -> Shows the code at this point
 
(gbd) print p
 -> Shows the memory location
 >> $1 = (struct proc *) 0x12345678
 
 (gdb) print p->state
 -> Shows the process state
 >> $2 = SLEEPING
