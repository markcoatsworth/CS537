Project P2a: The Unix Shell

I implemented the mysh shell by myself (with some help from Google and Stack Overflow).

It currently scores 23 out of 24 in the provided test.

None of the extra credit tests are implemented. 

The code I've used to parse the shell input is largely taken from the following article:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15539708/passing-an-array-to-execvp-from-the-users-input

This works by using the strtok() function to break the input into a series of tokens, using the space and newline characters as delimiters. 
It then assigns each token to a char pointer array.
